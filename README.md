We are building a networking web app that helps organize contacts, email reminders, and call notes into one simple website. Gone are the days of messy spreadsheets and nested folder Google drives full of call notes which are unintuitive, difficult to maintain, and full of loopholes.

## Architecture

Code:
- Use the Redux starter pack for the frontend
- Use the Kahoot/API starter pack for the backend in the Project API Goloco Repo

Libraries:
Front end:
- React
- Redux
- Framer Motion
Back end:
- Mongoose
- Express

## Setup

Npm install for both the API and the front end
Npm start on a separate console for back end to start the API (until we have a steady back end on Atlas)

## Deployment

Deploy front end on OnRender
Deploy Backend on OnRender similar to the Kahoot SA, see https://brunchlabs.notion.site/SA6-Kahoot-API-f9e5bbc269654c918a14b0860ab510b7
Create a cloud database on Atlas
